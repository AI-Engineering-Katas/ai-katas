# Long-form workshop sequence

## Prep (30 minutes)

1. Capabilities Slideshow
2. Capabilities QA

## Groups and Katas (15 minutes)

1. Sort selves by experience
2. Split into groups

### Rules

- The katas are deliberately vague and contain ambiguities, like problems in real life
- As in real life, make assertions based upon your knowledge of the problem
- Gwen and Lee are your POs, DevOps team, Stakeholders, UX team, etc. Ask them questions to resolve ambiguity
- Feel free to use the Capability Compendium
- If you have questions about technology you are unfamiliar with, ask ChatGPT/Anthropic
- Do not ask ChatGPT/Anthropic questions like "Design a system for this kata"
