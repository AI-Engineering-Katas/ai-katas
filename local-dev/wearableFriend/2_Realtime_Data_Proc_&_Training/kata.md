### AI Engineering Sub-Kata: Real-Time Data Processing and Model Training

#### Background

As the device collects data, it needs to process this information to refine its models gradually. This real-time or near-real-time training allows the AI to adapt and improve its understanding of different topics continuously.

#### Current Process

Model training typically happens in centralized data centers after all data has been collected and labeled. Continuous, on-device training is less common and presents unique challenges.

#### Key Challenges

- Processing large amounts of data in real-time without draining the device's battery or slowing down performance.
- Ensuring that the models are updated incrementally and do not require re-training from scratch with each new batch of data.
- Balancing the need for real-time processing with the device's hardware limitations.

#### Objectives

- Develop a system for on-device data processing and incremental model training.
- Implement optimization techniques to manage the device's resources effectively during training.
- Ensure that models can learn from new data without forgetting previously learned information (avoid catastrophic forgetting).

#### Data Sources

- Real-time video and audio data collected by the device.
- Previously trained models that need to be updated with new data.
- Processing logs and performance metrics to optimize training algorithms.

#### Engineering Tasks

- Design algorithms for incremental learning and real-time model updates.
- Implement resource management tools to monitor and optimize battery usage and processing power.
- Develop mechanisms to validate model performance continuously and detect when re-training might be necessary.

#### Constraints

- The device's limited battery life and processing capabilities.
- The need to maintain user privacy, especially when processing sensitive data.
- Ensuring that real-time processing does not disrupt the user experience.

#### Evaluation Criteria

- Efficiency and accuracy of the real-time processing and model training.
- Impact on the deviceâ€™s battery life and overall performance.
- Model performance improvements as a result of continuous learning.

#### Bonus Considerations

- Implement federated learning techniques to combine model updates across multiple devices while maintaining data privacy.
- Explore hardware acceleration (e.g., using specialized chips) to enhance on-device training capabilities.
