## NOSE

### Needs

SEP's clients have and will continue to request AI solutions to business problems that our engineers traditionally solve with deterministic algorithms. Demand for data-driven solutions increases. SEP's capacity to deliver context-aware applications has not kept pace. Further, SEP engineers are really smart and judge the time required to learn, vet, and master a new tool to be greater than the time spent accomplishing the task with the tools they know. You need SEP engineers to engage with business problems that cannot be solved effectively with the tools they have, so that the value proposition for learning new tools becomes clear. You need SEPeers to know where to start when given an AI project.

### Objectives

After participating in this workshop, 20 SEP engineers will be able to map business problems to AI capabilities, design AI-powered solutions using their existing software expertise, and confidently select appropriate AI solutions for implementation.
SEPeers will possess a structured process for decomposing complex data challenges into simple components that can be developed as AI services.
Through hands-on experience during the workshop, they will discover that their existing software design expertise readily translates to architecting AI-enabled solutions.
The workshop will equip them with access to a curated collection of commercially licensed models - including LLMs, embedding models, and time series classifiers - that can be easily containerized and deployed using their existing DevOps chops.
Additionally, they will have ongoing access to a continually improving resource that bridges the gap between user requirements and industry terminology, enabling them to confidently navigate and communicate within the AI solution space.

### Solution

The AI Solutions Workshop is a hands-on, collaborative experience designed to bridge the gap between traditional software engineering and AI-powered solutions. The workshop begins with a 30-minute foundational session where attendees are introduced to two essential tools: the AI Building Blocks site, which catalogs AI capabilities and their corresponding solution fields, and user journey mapping, demonstrated through video instruction and a practical walkthrough of a reference implementation.

Following this introduction, the 20 participants divide into five groups of four and receive carefully crafted business problem "katas" that highlight scenarios where traditional algorithmic approaches fall short. For example, one kata presents a healthcare startup seeking to predict health issues in elderly patients by analyzing patterns across vital signs, electronic health records, and telehealth sessions - a complex problem that defies traditional if-then logic. For the next two hours, each group engages in a structured design process: they first map their users' current journey, identify opportunities for AI enhancement, and then design a new journey supported by AI capabilities. Throughout this exercise, groups have access to Lee and a co-facilitator who provide guidance on mapping business problems to specific AI capabilities and selecting appropriate solutions from the Building Blocks site.

The workshop culminates in a 60-minute review session where each group presents their solution to their peers. This presentation format serves multiple purposes: it allows engineers to see how their existing software consulting skills translate to AI consulting, exposes them to various practical applications of AI services, and builds confidence in discussing AI solutions using industry-standard terminology. The interactive feedback session also allows participants to discuss the tradeoffs of their approaches, and challenge each other to devise different solutions.

### Evidence

I have run this workshop seven times over Zoom and twice in person, once at SEP and once at a software conference. At every session, participants were excited to share their solutions with each other. They stuck around after the event to debate approaches with folks they hadn't met, and they took photos of systems that other groups designed.
Participants always enjoy the hands-on nature of the workshop, and at the in-person sessions, software engineers have told me that they are going to back to their company to implement the solution they designed.
