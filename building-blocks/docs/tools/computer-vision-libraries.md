# Computer Vision Libraries

Libraries for processing, analyzing, and understanding visual data.

## Supported Solution Fields

- [Object Detection](../solutions/object-detection)
- [Image Classification](../solutions/image-classification)

## When to Use

- When processing visual data
- When extracting image features
- When analyzing visual content
- When building vision pipelines

## When Not to Use

- When simple image processing suffices
- When real-time processing isn't needed
- When data isn't visual

## Tradeoffs

- **Speed vs Accuracy**: Better accuracy needs more compute
- **Flexibility vs Complexity**: More features mean steeper learning curve
- **Memory vs Performance**: Better models need more resources
