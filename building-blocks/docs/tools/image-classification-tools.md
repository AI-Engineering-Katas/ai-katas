# Image Classification Tools

Tools and libraries designed for image classification tasks.

## Supported Solution Fields

- [Image Understanding](../solutions/image-classification)

## When to Use

- When you need to classify images into categories
- When you have labeled image datasets for training
- When you want to implement custom image classifiers

## When Not to Use

- When you need a general-purpose solution
- When you lack sufficient labeled data
- When you need real-time predictions

## Tradeoffs

- **Feature Engineering**: Requires good feature representation
- **Cold Start Problem**: New categories may not be effectively classified

## Commercial Implementations

- **Keras**

  - High-level neural networks API
  - Supports image classification with various architectures

- **OpenCV**
  - Open-source computer vision library
  - Supports image processing and classification

## Common Combinations

- Object detection systems
- Facial recognition systems
- Medical image analysis

## Case Study: Medical Image Classification
