# 3D Vision Libraries

Libraries for processing and analyzing three-dimensional visual data.

## Supported Solution Fields

- [Object Detection](../solutions/object-detection)
- [Semantic Segmentation](../solutions/semantic-segmentation)

## When to Use

- When processing 3D data
- When analyzing depth information
- When working with point clouds
- When need spatial understanding

## When Not to Use

- When 2D analysis suffices
- When depth data unavailable
- When real-time not needed

## Tradeoffs

- **Accuracy vs Speed**: Better accuracy needs more processing
- **Resolution vs Performance**: Higher resolution needs more compute
- **Features vs Complexity**: More features mean steeper learning curve

## Commercial Implementations

- **Open3D**

  - Open-source 3D processing
  - Point cloud support
  - Visualization tools
