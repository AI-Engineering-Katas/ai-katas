## Supported Solution Fields

- [Natural Language Processing](../solutions/natural-language-processing)
- [Content-based Filtering](../solutions/content-based-filtering)
- [Neural Search](../solutions/neural-search)

## When to Use

- When you need structured knowledge storage
- When you need semantic relationships
- When you need hierarchical organization
- When you need knowledge graphs

## When Not to Use

- When you only need document storage
- When you don't need relationship mapping
- When simple search is sufficient
- When you don't need knowledge organization

## Tradeoffs

- **Structure vs Flexibility**: More structure means less flexibility
- **Complexity vs Usability**: More features mean steeper learning curve
- **Integration vs Independence**: Better integration means more dependencies
- **Power vs Simplicity**: More capability means more complexity
