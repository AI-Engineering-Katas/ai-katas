# Text Analytics APIs

Cloud-based APIs that provide ready-to-use text analysis capabilities including entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and key phrase extraction.

## Supported Solution Fields

- [Natural Language Processing](../solutions/natural-language-processing)
- [Named Entity Recognition](../solutions/named-entity-recognition)
- [Sentiment Analysis](../solutions/sentiment-analysis)
- [Cross-lingual Understanding](../solutions/cross-lingual-understanding)

## When to Use

- When you need quick implementation of text analysis features
- When you want managed, scalable text processing
- When you don't want to maintain ML infrastructure
- When you need production-ready API reliability

## When Not to Use

- When you need full control over the analysis pipeline
- When you have strict data privacy requirements
- When you need highly customized text analysis
- When cost per API call is a concern at scale
