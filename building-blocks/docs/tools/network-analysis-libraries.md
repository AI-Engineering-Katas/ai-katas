# Network Analysis Libraries

Libraries for analyzing network structures and discovering patterns in connected data.

## Supported Solution Fields

- [Network Analysis](../solutions/network-analysis)
- [Pattern Mining](../solutions/pattern-mining)

## When to Use

- When analyzing network topology
- When finding communities
- When measuring centrality
- When detecting clusters

## When Not to Use

- When data isn't networked
- When simple metrics suffice
- When visualization is primary need

## Tradeoffs

- **Algorithm Choice vs Speed**: More complex algorithms take longer
- **Scale vs Memory**: Larger networks need more resources
- **Accuracy vs Performance**: Better results need more computation

## Commercial Implementations

  - Python library for complex networks
  - Comprehensive algorithms
  - Research standard

- **igraph**
  - High-performance graph analysis
  - Multiple language support
  - Visualization capabilities

## Common Combinations

- Social network analysis
- Citation networks
- Infrastructure mapping
