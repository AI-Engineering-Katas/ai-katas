# Data Mining Frameworks

Frameworks for discovering patterns and insights in large datasets.

## Supported Solution Fields

- [Pattern Mining](../solutions/pattern-mining)
- [Network Analysis](../solutions/network-analysis)

## When to Use

- When mining large datasets
- When discovering patterns
- When analyzing relationships
- When finding correlations

## When Not to Use

- When data is small
- When patterns are obvious
- When real-time analysis needed

## Tradeoffs

- **Power vs Complexity**: More features mean steeper learning curve
- **Scale vs Speed**: Larger datasets take longer to process
- **Flexibility vs Ease**: More options require more expertise
