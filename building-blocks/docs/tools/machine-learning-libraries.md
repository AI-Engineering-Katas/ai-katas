# Machine Learning Libraries

Libraries that provide a wide range of algorithms and tools for building machine learning models, including classification tasks.

## Supported Solution Fields

- [Multi-class Classification](../solutions/multi-class-classification)
- [Pattern Recognition](../solutions/pattern-recognition)

## When to Use

- When you need a flexible library for various ML tasks
- When you want to implement custom classification algorithms
- When you have structured data for training

## When Not to Use

- When you need a fully managed solution
- When you lack data for training
- When you need real-time predictions

## Tradeoffs

- **Flexibility vs Complexity**: More features can lead to a steeper learning curve
- **Performance vs Usability**: Some libraries may require more tuning for optimal performance

## Commercial Implementations

- **Scikit-learn**

  - Comprehensive library for classical machine learning
  - Easy to use and well-documented

- **H2O.ai**
  - Open-source platform for machine learning
  - Supports various algorithms and autoML

## Common Combinations

- E-commerce platforms
- Fraud detection systems
- Customer segmentation
