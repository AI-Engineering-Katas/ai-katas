# Spatial Analysis Frameworks

Frameworks for analyzing spatial relationships and 3D scene understanding.

## Supported Solution Fields

- [Object Detection](../solutions/object-detection)
- [Semantic Segmentation](../solutions/semantic-segmentation)

## When to Use

- When analyzing spatial relationships
- When need scene understanding
- When working with 3D data
- When mapping environments

## When Not to Use

- When 2D analysis suffices
- When simple metrics needed
- When real-time not required

## Tradeoffs

- **Complexity vs Speed**: More analysis needs more time
- **Accuracy vs Resources**: Better accuracy needs more compute
- **Features vs Learning**: More features mean steeper curve

## Commercial Implementations

- **CGAL**

  - Computational geometry
  - Robust algorithms
  - Research standard

- **OpenScene**
  - Scene understanding
  - Spatial relationships
  - Real-time capable

## Common Combinations

- Autonomous systems
- Smart environments
- Robotic planning
