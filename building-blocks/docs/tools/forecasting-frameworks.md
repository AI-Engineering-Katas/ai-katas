# Forecasting Frameworks

End-to-end frameworks for building and deploying forecasting models.

## Supported Solution Fields

- [Predictive Analytics](../solutions/predictive-analytics)
- [Sequential Modeling](../solutions/sequential-modeling)

## When to Use

- When you need comprehensive forecasting solutions
- When you want automated model selection
- When you need scalable predictions

## When Not to Use

- When you need simple time series analysis
- When you want full control over algorithms
- When you have limited data

## Tradeoffs

- **Automation vs Control**: More automation means less flexibility
- **Features vs Learning Curve**: More features require more training
- **Cost vs Scale**: Enterprise features come at higher cost
