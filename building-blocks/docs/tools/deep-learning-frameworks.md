# Deep Learning Frameworks

Frameworks designed for building and training deep learning models, including those for classification tasks.

## Supported Solution Fields

- [Multi-class Classification](../solutions/multi-class-classification)
- [Pattern Recognition](../solutions/pattern-recognition)

## When to Use

- When you need to build complex models
- When you have large datasets for training
- When you want to leverage GPU acceleration

## When Not to Use

- When you need a simple model
- When you lack sufficient data
- When you need a fully managed solution

## Tradeoffs

- **Complexity vs Performance**: More complex models can yield better accuracy
- **Training Time vs Accuracy**: Longer training times may lead to better models

## Commercial Implementations
