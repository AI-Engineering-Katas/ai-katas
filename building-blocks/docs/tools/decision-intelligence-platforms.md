# Decision Intelligence Platforms

Platforms and frameworks for implementing data-driven decision making systems and automated decision optimization.

## Supported Solution Fields

- [Decision Intelligence](../solutions/decision-intelligence)
- [Predictive Analytics](../solutions/predictive-analytics)
- [Autonomous Systems](../solutions/autonomous-systems)

## When to Use

- When automating complex decision processes
- When optimizing resource allocation
- When implementing policy learning
- When need risk assessment
- When building decision support systems

## When Not to Use

- When decisions are simple and rule-based
- When human judgment is legally required
- When data quality is poor
- When explainability is critical
- When real-time decisions aren't needed

## Tradeoffs

- **Accuracy vs Interpretability**: More complex models are harder to explain
- **Speed vs Optimality**: Faster decisions may be suboptimal
- **Flexibility vs Consistency**: More flexible systems may be less consistent
- **Automation vs Control**: More automation means less human oversight
