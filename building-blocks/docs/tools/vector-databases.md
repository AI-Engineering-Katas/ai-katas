# Vector Databases

Vector databases are specialized database systems designed to store and efficiently query high-dimensional vectors, which are commonly used in AI and machine learning applications.

## When to Use

- When you need to store and query large collections of embeddings
- When you need fast similarity search across millions or billions of vectors
- When you need to combine vector search with traditional metadata filtering
- When you need to scale vector operations horizontally

## When Not to Use

- When your dataset is small (< 100k vectors)
- When you don't need real-time updates
- When simple approximate nearest neighbor algorithms would suffice
- When you're primarily doing exact matching rather than similarity search

## Tradeoffs

- **Cost vs Scale**: Higher costs for larger vector collections
- **Accuracy vs Speed**: Trade-off between search accuracy and query performance
- **Flexibility vs Performance**: Some databases optimize for specific vector operations at the expense of general-purpose functionality
- **Managed vs Self-hosted**: Considerations between operational complexity and control

## Commercial Implementations

- **Pinecone**

  - Fully managed vector database

  - Good documentation and support
  - Higher cost per vector

- **Weaviate**

  - Open source
  - Can be self-hosted
  - Strong schema support
  - Good for hybrid searches

- **Milvus**

  - Open source

## Common Combinations

- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems
- Recommendation engines
- Image similarity search
- Semantic search applications
- Document retrieval systems

## Case Study: E-commerce Product Search

A large e-commerce platform implemented a vector database to power their product search and recommendation system:

### Challenge

- 10M+ products
- Need for semantic search
- Real-time updates
- Complex filtering requirements

### Solution

- Implemented Pinecone vector database
- Stored product embeddings generated from images and descriptions
- Combined vector search with metadata filtering
- Integrated with existing PostgreSQL catalog

### Results

- 3x improvement in search relevance
- 40% reduction in search latency
- Easier maintenance compared to previous custom solution
- Improved scalability for holiday season traffic
