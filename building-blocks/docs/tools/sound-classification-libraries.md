# Sound Classification Libraries

Libraries specifically designed for classifying and categorizing different types of sounds and audio events.

## Supported Solution Fields

- [Audio Classification](../solutions/audio-classification)
- [Speech Recognition](../solutions/speech-recognition)
- [Sound Event Detection](../solutions/sound-event-detection)

## When to Use

- When you need to identify specific sound types
- When you need to categorize audio content
- When you need automated audio tagging
- When you need environmental sound monitoring

## When Not to Use

- When you only need basic audio playback
- When you need real-time processing
- When you have very short audio clips
- When you need speech-to-text specifically

## Tradeoffs

- **Accuracy vs Speed**: Better classification often requires more processing time
- **Generalization vs Specificity**: General models vs domain-specific ones
- **Model Size vs Performance**: Larger models provide better accuracy but require more resources
- **Training Data vs Out-of-box**: Custom training versus pre-trained models

## Commercial Implementations
