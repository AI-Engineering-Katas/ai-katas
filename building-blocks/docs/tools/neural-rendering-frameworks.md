# Neural Rendering Frameworks

Frameworks and libraries specialized in neural rendering, including NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) implementations and differentiable rendering tools.

## Supported Solution Fields

- [Neural Rendering](../solutions/neural-rendering)
- [3D Modeling](../solutions/3d-modeling)
- [Computer Vision](../solutions/computer-vision)

## When to Use

- When implementing neural radiance fields
- When creating novel view synthesis
- When building photo-realistic rendering
- When doing scene reconstruction
- When developing real-time neural graphics

## When Not to Use

- When traditional rendering suffices
- When computational resources are limited
- When real-time performance is critical
- When scene complexity is low
- When high-quality input data unavailable

## Tradeoffs

- **Quality vs Speed**: Better quality requires longer rendering time
- **Memory vs Resolution**: Higher resolution needs more memory
- **Training Time vs Quality**: Better results need longer training
- **Flexibility vs Performance**: More general models may be slower
