# 3D Modeling Tools

Tools and libraries for creating, manipulating, and processing 3D models and geometries.

## Supported Solution Fields

- [3D Modeling](../solutions/3d-modeling)
- [Neural Rendering](../solutions/neural-rendering)

## When to Use

- When creating 3D models programmatically
- When processing mesh data
- When need geometry manipulation
- When working with 3D assets
- When automating model creation

## When Not to Use

- When only 2D processing is needed
- When manual modeling is sufficient
- When computational resources are limited
- When real-time processing isn't required

## Tradeoffs

- **Quality vs Performance**: Higher quality meshes require more processing power
- **Automation vs Control**: More automation means less fine-grained control
- **Features vs Learning Curve**: More features increase complexity
- **Memory vs Detail**: Higher detail models consume more memory
