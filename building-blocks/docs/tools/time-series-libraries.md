# Time Series Libraries

Libraries specialized in analyzing and forecasting time series data.

## Supported Solution Fields

- [Predictive Analytics](../solutions/predictive-analytics)
- [Sequential Modeling](../solutions/sequential-modeling)

## When to Use

- When you need to analyze temporal patterns
- When you have sequential data
- When you need to handle seasonality and trends

## When Not to Use

- When your data isn't time-dependent
- When you need real-time predictions
- When you have non-sequential data

## Tradeoffs

- **Accuracy vs Speed**: More complex models take longer to train
- **Flexibility vs Complexity**: More features mean steeper learning curve
- **Memory vs Performance**: Longer sequences require more resources
