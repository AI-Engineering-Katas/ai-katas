# Collaborative Filtering Libraries

Libraries and frameworks that implement collaborative filtering techniques for generating recommendations.

## Supported Solution Fields

- [Collaborative Filtering](../solutions/collaborative-filtering)

## When to Use

- When you want to build a recommendation system from scratch
- When you have user-item interaction data
- When you need to implement user-based or item-based filtering

## When Not to Use

- When you need a fully managed solution
- When you lack data on user interactions
- When you need real-time recommendations

## Tradeoffs

- **Simplicity vs Performance**: Simpler models may not capture complex patterns
- **Cold Start Problem**: New users/items may not be effectively recommended
- **Scalability**: Some libraries may struggle with large datasets

## Commercial Implementations

- **Surprise**

  - Python library for building and analyzing recommender systems
  - Easy to use and flexible

- **LightFM**

  - Hybrid recommendation model
  - Supports both collaborative and content-based filtering

- **TensorFlow Recommenders**
  - TensorFlow-based library for building recommendation systems
  - Supports deep learning approaches

## Common Combinations

- E-commerce platforms
- Content streaming services
- Social media applications
