# Audio Feature Extraction Tools

Libraries and tools for extracting meaningful features and characteristics from audio signals.

## Supported Solution Fields

- [Audio Classification](../solutions/audio-classification)
- [Speech Recognition](../solutions/speech-recognition)

## When to Use

- When you need to analyze audio characteristics
- When you need to extract spectral features
- When you need to process audio for machine learning
- When you need to identify audio patterns

## When Not to Use

- When you only need basic audio playback
- When you need real-time audio processing
- When you have extremely short audio clips
- When you only need simple amplitude analysis

## Tradeoffs

- **Quality vs Performance**: Higher quality features require more processing
- **Complexity vs Interpretability**: More complex features can be harder to interpret
- **Memory vs Precision**: Higher precision requires more memory
- **Speed vs Feature Count**: More features mean slower processing
