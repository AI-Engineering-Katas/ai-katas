# Graph Analytics Platforms

Platforms for analyzing and discovering patterns in graph and network data.

## Supported Solution Fields

- [Network Analysis](../solutions/network-analysis)
- [Pattern Mining](../solutions/pattern-mining)

## When to Use

- When analyzing complex networks
- When discovering graph patterns
- When mapping relationships
- When visualizing networks

## When Not to Use

- When data isn't relationship-based
- When simple statistical analysis suffices
- When real-time processing is needed

## Tradeoffs

- **Scale vs Performance**: Larger graphs need more resources
- **Flexibility vs Complexity**: More features mean steeper learning curve
- **Visualization vs Size**: Large graphs are harder to visualize

## Commercial Implementations

- **Neo4j Graph Data Science**
