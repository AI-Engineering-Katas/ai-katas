# Cross-Modal Learning Libraries

Libraries and frameworks for processing and learning from multiple data modalities simultaneously.

## Supported Solution Fields

- [Cross-Modal Learning](../solutions/cross-modal-learning)
- [Multi-Modal Understanding](../solutions/multi-modal-understanding)
- [Neural Search](../solutions/neural-search)

## When to Use

- When working with multiple data types simultaneously
- When need to align different modalities
- When building multi-modal AI systems
- When implementing cross-modal retrieval
- When developing multi-modal embeddings

## When Not to Use

- When working with single modality data
- When simple unimodal models suffice
- When data modalities are highly imbalanced
- When computational resources are limited

## Tradeoffs

- **Complexity vs Performance**: More modalities increase model complexity
- **Training Data vs Accuracy**: Need paired data across modalities
- **Flexibility vs Specialization**: Generic models vs domain-specific ones
- **Resource Usage vs Capabilities**: Multi-modal models need more compute
