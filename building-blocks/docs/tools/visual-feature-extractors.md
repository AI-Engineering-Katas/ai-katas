# Visual Feature Extractors

Tools for extracting meaningful features from visual data.

## Supported Solution Fields

- [Object Detection](../solutions/object-detection)
- [Image Classification](../solutions/image-classification)

## When to Use

- When extracting visual features
- When need embeddings
- When analyzing content
- When building search systems

## When Not to Use

- When raw pixels suffice
- When simple processing needed
- When features are known

## Tradeoffs

- **Depth vs Speed**: Deeper features take longer
- **Generality vs Specificity**: General features vs task-specific
- **Quality vs Resources**: Better features need more compute

## Commercial Implementations

- **TensorFlow Hub**
  - Pre-trained feature extractors
