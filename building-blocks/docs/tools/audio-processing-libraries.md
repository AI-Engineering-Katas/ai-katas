# Audio Processing Libraries

Essential tools for loading, manipulating, and analyzing audio signals at various levels of abstraction.

## Supported Solution Fields

- [Audio Classification](../solutions/audio-classification)
- [Speech Recognition](../solutions/speech-recognition)
- [Sound Event Detection](../solutions/sound-event-detection)

## When to Use

- When you need low-level audio signal processing
- When you need to extract audio features
- When you need to manipulate audio waveforms
- When you need audio visualization capabilities

## When Not to Use

- When you only need simple audio playback
- When you need real-time processing only
- When you need high-level audio analysis only
- When you need specialized speech recognition

## Tradeoffs

- **Performance vs Flexibility**: Lower-level control means more complex code
- **Memory vs Speed**: Larger buffer sizes vs processing latency
- **Feature Set vs Learning Curve**: More features mean steeper learning
- **Python vs Native Code**: Ease of use vs maximum performance
