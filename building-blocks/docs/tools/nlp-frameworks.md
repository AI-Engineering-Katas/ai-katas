# NLP Frameworks

Open-source libraries and frameworks for natural language processing tasks, providing building blocks for text analysis and understanding.


## Supported Solution Fields

- [Machine Translation](../solutions/machine-translation)
- [Language Modeling](../solutions/language-modeling)
- [Cross-lingual Understanding](../solutions/cross-lingual-understanding)

## When to Use

- When you need fine-grained control over NLP pipelines
- When you want to build custom text processing solutions
- When you have specific performance requirements
- When you need offline processing capabilities

## When Not to Use

- When you need managed services
- When you lack NLP expertise
- When development time is limited
- When you need enterprise support

## Tradeoffs

- **Control vs Complexity**: More control but requires more expertise
