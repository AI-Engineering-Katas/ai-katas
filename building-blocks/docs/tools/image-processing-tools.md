# Image Processing Tools

Tools for manipulating and analyzing image data.

## Supported Solution Fields

- [Object Detection](../solutions/object-detection)
- [Image Classification](../solutions/image-classification)

## When to Use

- When preprocessing images
- When enhancing visual data
- When extracting features
- When batch processing images

## When Not to Use

- When deep learning is required
- When real-time processing needed
- When raw data isn't visual

## Tradeoffs

- **Quality vs Speed**: Better quality needs more processing
- **Automation vs Control**: More automation means less control
- **Features vs Resources**: More features need more compute
