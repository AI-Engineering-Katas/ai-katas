# Similarity Search and Embedding Storage

Similarity Search and Embedding Storage solutions enable efficient storage, indexing, and retrieval of vector embeddings to find similar items in large datasets.

## Key Capabilities Used

- [Pattern Discovery](../capabilities/pattern-discovery)
- [Classification](../capabilities/classification)

## Overview

Modern similarity search solutions provide:

- Vector embedding generation and storage
- Efficient indexing algorithms (e.g., HNSW, IVF)
- Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search
- Scalable vector database infrastructure
- Low-latency querying

## Common Use Cases

- Semantic search engines
- Recommendation systems
- Content deduplication
- Image and audio similarity matching
- Document retrieval
- Product matching

## Implementation Tools

For implementing similarity search, consider these tools:

- [Vector Databases](../05-tools/vector-databases)
- [Vector Similarity Search](../05-tools/vector-similarity-search)
- [Search Engines](../05-tools/search-engines)

## Best Practices

- Choose appropriate embedding dimensions
- Select indexing algorithms based on dataset size
- Balance accuracy vs. speed tradeoffs
- Implement proper data preprocessing
- Consider scaling requirements early
