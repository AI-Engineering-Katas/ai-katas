## Architectural Katas adapted for AI Engineering

AI-themed katas for use in a Ted Neward-style Architecture Kata session

## Preparing for a session

- Download Zoom. We will form groups in a Zoom session. We will work our katas in Zoom breakout rooms
- Create a canvas in [draw.io](https://draw.io). We use draw.io in lieu of a physical whiteboard

## Schedule

Four stages:

1. Preparation: Get your project team together
1. Discussion Phase: Figure out what you're building and build it
1. Peer Review Phase: Present your solution
1. Voting Phase: Final feedback from the group on the proposal

_see [rules](./rules.md) for detailed descriptions of each stage_
