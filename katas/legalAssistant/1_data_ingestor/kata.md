## Data Ingestion for Legal Research Assistant

## Description

Your tech lead has decided that the most efficient way to create a queryable datastore for your Legal Research Assisant is to create an internal representation of all the available documents. Design a system that ingests and preprocesses a large volume of legal documents, cases, rulings, and transcripts. The datastore that your data pipeline creates will support katas 2-5: natural language processing, query processing, research aggregation, and an interaction QA system.

## Requirements

1. **Accuracy**: Do not change the contents of data on ingestion
2. **Data Variety**: Handle a variety of formats and structures
3. **Data Quality**: Handle ingestion of low quality datasources (e.g., scanned documents with OCR errors, audio recordings captured on poorly-maintained tape)

## Data Sources

1. **Legal Databases**: Access to comprehensive legal databases containing case documents in various formats.
2. **Court Case Archives**: Historical collections of court cases in digital format, including scanned documents.
3. **Legal Publications**: Journals, articles, and other publications that may be part of the ingestion pipeline.
