### AI Engineering Sub-Kata: Data Ingestion for Legal Research Assistant

#### Background

In the legal field, particularly within entertainment IP law, handling large volumes of legal documents and cases is crucial. Automating the ingestion and preprocessing of these documents is the first step in creating an AI-driven Legal Research Assistant. This sub-kata focuses on the development of a data ingestion pipeline that will form the foundation for more complex AI tasks, such as natural language processing, query processing, and research aggregation.

#### Current Process

1. **Manual Upload**: Legal documents and court cases are manually uploaded into internal databases.
2. **Basic Preprocessing**: Documents are occasionally preprocessed to extract basic metadata but require further manual analysis.
3. **Inconsistent Formats**: Legal documents come in various formats (PDFs, Word documents, scanned images), leading to challenges in consistent data ingestion.

#### Key Challenges

1. **Data Variety**: Legal documents are provided in multiple formats and structures, requiring robust preprocessing techniques.
2. **Data Volume**: High volumes of documents must be processed efficiently.
3. **Data Quality**: Ensuring accurate extraction of information from documents, even when the source material is of low quality (e.g., scanned documents with OCR errors).
4. **Scalability**: The ingestion pipeline must scale to handle growing datasets as more documents are added.

#### Objectives

1. **Automate Ingestion**: Create a pipeline that automatically ingests and preprocesses legal documents from various sources.
2. **Standardize Formats**: Develop methods to standardize different document formats for consistent processing.
3. **Extract Metadata**: Implement processes to extract key metadata (e.g., case name, date, jurisdiction) from ingested documents.
4. **Ensure Scalability**: Build a pipeline that can scale with increasing data volume while maintaining performance.

#### Data Sources

1. **Legal Databases**: Access to comprehensive legal databases containing case documents in various formats.
2. **Court Case Archives**: Historical collections of court cases in digital format, including scanned documents.
3. **Legal Publications**: Journals, articles, and other publications that may be part of the ingestion pipeline.

#### Engineering Tasks

1. **Data Collection**: Develop methods to automatically collect legal documents from specified sources.
2. **Format Conversion**: Implement tools to convert various document formats (e.g., PDFs, Word documents, images) into a standardized format for processing.
3. **Text Extraction**: Utilize Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for extracting text from scanned documents and PDFs.
4. **Metadata Extraction**: Create algorithms to automatically extract key metadata from documents, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
5. **Data Storage**: Design a storage solution that efficiently stores the ingested documents and extracted metadata, allowing for easy retrieval.
6. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage issues such as OCR inaccuracies, corrupt files, or unsupported formats.

#### Constraints

1. **Data Privacy**: Ensure compliance with legal data privacy regulations during data ingestion and storage.
2. **Accuracy**: Maintain high accuracy in text and metadata extraction, especially when dealing with low-quality documents.
3. **Performance**: The pipeline should handle large volumes of data efficiently without significant delays.
4. **Scalability**: The ingestion system must be able to scale with increasing data volumes and additional data sources.

#### Evaluation Criteria

1. **Accuracy**: Measure the precision and recall of text and metadata extraction processes.
2. **Efficiency**: Assess the time taken to ingest and preprocess large batches of documents.
3. **Scalability**: Test the system's ability to scale as the volume of ingested data increases.
4. **Error Rate**: Track the frequency and severity of errors in document processing and ingestion.

#### Bonus Considerations

1. **Incremental Ingestion**: Implement features that allow the pipeline to ingest new documents incrementally without reprocessing the entire dataset.
2. **Data Validation**: Introduce validation steps to ensure the integrity and quality of ingested data.
3. **Flexible Architecture**: Design the ingestion pipeline to be modular, allowing for easy updates and the addition of new data sources or preprocessing techniques.
4. **Real-Time Processing**: Explore options for real-time ingestion and preprocessing of documents as they are received.
