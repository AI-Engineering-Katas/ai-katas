### AI Engineering Sub-Kata: Telehealth Consultations and Virtual Check-Ups

#### Background

Telehealth consultations and virtual check-ups provide a convenient way for elderly patients to access healthcare services, especially for those with mobility issues or those living in remote areas.

#### Current Process

Telehealth services are often provided as a separate platform, requiring patients to navigate different systems and manually share health data with healthcare providers.

#### Key Challenges

- Integrating telehealth capabilities with real-time health monitoring.
- Ensuring smooth, reliable video and audio communication, especially with limited internet connectivity.
- Maintaining data security and patient privacy during virtual consultations.

#### Objectives

- Develop a telehealth system integrated with real-time health monitoring.
- Ensure high-quality video and audio for virtual consultations.
- Implement security measures to protect patient data during telehealth sessions.

#### Data Sources

- Real-time monitoring data from wearable devices.
- EHRs and patient health history.
- Communication data (audio/video streams) from telehealth sessions.

#### Engineering Tasks

- Integrate telehealth functionalities with the monitoring system.
- Optimize video and audio communication for various network conditions.
- Implement end-to-end encryption and secure data transmission protocols.

#### Constraints

- Must comply with HIPAA and other healthcare regulations.
- Ensure compatibility with a wide range of devices used by elderly patients.
- Address potential connectivity issues in remote or underserved areas.

#### Evaluation Criteria

- Quality and reliability of telehealth sessions.
- Patient and provider satisfaction with the telehealth experience.
- Security and privacy of telehealth communications.

#### Bonus Considerations

- Explore AI-driven tools to assist healthcare providers during consultations (e.g., symptom analysis).
- Implement offline capabilities for areas with unreliable internet access.
