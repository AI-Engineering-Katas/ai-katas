### AI Engineering Sub-Kata: Vital Signs Monitoring System

#### Background

Elderly patients often require continuous monitoring of their vital signs to manage chronic conditions and prevent emergencies. Wearable devices can track metrics like heart rate, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels, providing real-time data to caregivers and medical professionals.

#### Current Process

Currently, many elderly patients rely on periodic check-ups and manual measurements for vital signs, which may lead to delays in identifying health issues. Caregivers and healthcare providers must manually review health data and react to issues, often after symptoms have already worsened.

#### Key Challenges

- Ensuring continuous and accurate data collection from wearable devices.
- Managing large volumes of real-time health data from multiple patients.
- Detecting anomalies or emergencies promptly.
- Maintaining patient comfort and usability, especially for those with minimal technical expertise.

#### Objectives

- Develop a reliable system for real-time monitoring of vital signs using wearable devices.
- Implement algorithms to detect and alert caregivers/medical professionals of any anomalies or emergencies.
- Ensure the system is user-friendly for elderly patients.

#### Data Sources

- Real-time data from wearable devices (heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose levels).
- Patient demographic and health history data.
- Anomaly detection models.

#### Engineering Tasks

- Integrate wearable devices for continuous data collection.
- Develop and train machine learning models for anomaly detection.
- Build a notification system for alerting caregivers/medical professionals.
- Design a user interface tailored for elderly users.

#### Constraints

- The solution must be HIPAA-compliant to ensure data privacy and security.
- Devices must be non-intrusive and comfortable for elderly users.
- The system should operate effectively with limited internet connectivity.

#### Evaluation Criteria

- Accuracy and timeliness of anomaly detection.
- Usability and satisfaction among elderly patients.
- Compliance with HIPAA and other relevant regulations.

#### Bonus Considerations

- Implement predictive analytics to anticipate health issues before they occur.
- Explore integration with other health monitoring tools (e.g., fall detection).
