# Jet Engine Part Manufacturing

## Scenario

A jet engine manufacturer wants to develop an AI system to optimize their manufacturing process for small, delicate engine parts, focusing on improving precision, reducing material waste, and managing tool wear in their robotic machining systems.

**Users:** Manufacturing operators, quality control teams, and process engineers at aerospace manufacturing facilities

## Additional Context

- The current process uses robotic machining with light-based inspection
- Tools wear down with use. Worn tools behave differently than new tools
- The quality team says that the current scrap rate is 50%
- Anomalies as small as 0.1mm must be detected
- As you might imagine, your AI solutions must comply with aerospace industry regulations

## Requirements

- Users want to know when something goes wrong
- After watching manufacturing operators work, you learned that a significant portion of the machining process depends on accurate mounting of raw materials
- Process engineers want to know when they should replace tools, in part because they can get a discount if they buy tools in bulk
- The quality control team wants evidence that the new system works
- Your client would rather not replace their existing robotic systems and inspection equipment
- Users want to know why the AI made its choices
