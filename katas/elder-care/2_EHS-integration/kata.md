### AI Engineering Sub-Kata: Electronic Health Records Integration

#### Background

Integration with electronic health records (EHR) is crucial for maintaining comprehensive patient profiles, enabling healthcare providers to deliver personalized care based on a patient's medical history.

#### Current Process

Many healthcare providers maintain EHRs separately from real-time monitoring systems, requiring manual data entry and increasing the risk of errors and delays.

#### Key Challenges

- Ensuring seamless and secure integration with various EHR systems.
- Synchronizing real-time data with existing patient records.
- Managing differences in data formats and standards across EHR platforms.

#### Objectives

- Develop a system to automatically sync real-time health data with patient EHRs.
- Ensure data consistency and integrity across platforms.
- Enable healthcare providers to access and update EHRs through the system.

#### Data Sources

- EHRs from various healthcare providers.
- Real-time monitoring data from wearable devices.
- Patient demographic and health history data.

#### Engineering Tasks

- Design and implement APIs for integrating with different EHR systems.
- Develop data mapping and transformation tools to standardize data formats.
- Build a secure data synchronization and storage solution.

#### Constraints

- Must comply with HIPAA and other healthcare data regulations.
- Ensure data integrity and prevent loss or corruption during synchronization.
- EHR systems may have varying degrees of openness and interoperability.

#### Evaluation Criteria

- Accuracy and reliability of EHR data synchronization.
- Compliance with relevant healthcare regulations.
- Ease of use for healthcare providers.

#### Bonus Considerations

- Explore integration with newer standards like FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources).
- Implement audit logs and reporting tools to track data changes and access.
