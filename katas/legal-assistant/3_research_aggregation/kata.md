## Research Aggregation for Legal Research Assistant

## Description

Legal professionals often need to sift through vast amounts of case law and legal documents to find relevant precedents and information that support their arguments. Legal professionals would like this process to take less time, but they don't want the output to be less accurate than what they do right now. You have been hired to automate the search, filtering, and aggregation of relevant legal cases. Assume that you have already implemented a natural-language-to-legal-query converter, in [kata 2_query_processing](../2_query_processing/kata.md)
