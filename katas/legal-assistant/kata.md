## Legal Research Assistant

### Scenario

A large entertainment IP law firm wants to develop an AI-powered legal research assistant that can find relevant case precedents, manage legal document alerts, and answer detailed questions about court cases to improve lawyer efficiency.

**Users:** Entertainment IP lawyers, paralegals, and legal researchers at major law firms

### Additional Context

- This law firm has subscriptions to three major law databases, a huge local store of paper documents, many on-site hard drives, cassette tapes, cds, and vhs tapes
- Lawyers currently spend significant time manually searching specialized legal databases
- The legal teams at this firm communicate with each other by email. They often work from home
- Paralegals want to spend less time gathering the context of a precedent. Finding the documents would save them time but they also want to make sure that they understand the documents that are found

### Requirements

- Legal teams want to know about new court decisions, new cases, and new laws that are relevant to their current case
- The CIO wants you to know that data privacy compliance is super important for all legal information processed
- Data that the law firm does not own should not be held for more than 24 hours
