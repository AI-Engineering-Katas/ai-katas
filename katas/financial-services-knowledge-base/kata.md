# Knowledge Base Assistant for a Financial Services Firm

## Scenario

A multinational financial services firm needs to develop a centralized, AI-powered knowledge base that allows employees to ask questions and quickly retrieve relevant documents. The system must handle complex financial queries, offer document summaries, and ensure that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized users.

Users: 10,000+ employees across multiple departments, globally distributed, in multiple time zones

## Additional Context

- Your project sponsor says that employees should be able to use natural language queries to access financial policies, compliance documents, and client records
- The knowledge base will integrate with existing document management and compliance systems
- The CIO assures you that internal documents are already pretty much mostly sorta configured with access policies that ensure only the right people who can see those documents can see them
- The assistant should automatically adapt responses to employees' roles and access levels, which the CIO assures you are mostly pretty accurate. The CIO emphasizes that it's super important to comply with data privacy laws
