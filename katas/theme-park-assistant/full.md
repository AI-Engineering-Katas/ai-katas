# Theme Park Assistant

## Scenario

A global theme park chain wants to develop an AI assistant that helps visitors plan their day based on preferences for rides, shows, dining options, and shopping. The assistant will dynamically recommend attractions, events, and merchandise, and create personalized itineraries for visitors based on real-time crowd levels, weather, and ride wait times.

Users: 1 million+ annual park visitors, operating across multiple locations worldwide

## Additional Context

- Integration with both external systems (e.g., weather forecasts) and internal systems (e.g. wait times on specific rides or maintenance schedules) will be necessary.
- Visitors will access the assistant via the parkâ€™s mobile app, and it should work offline for users without internet access.

## Requirements

- The system must account for individual visitor preferences (e.g., thrill-seekers, family-friendly) and provide real-time updates as conditions change (e.g., rain causing ride closures).
- The assistant must be able to direct users to themed merchandise and stores inside the park based on current location and interests.
- It must suggest alternative plans if rides or attractions close unexpectedly.
- The app should work offline to continue assisting visitors without an active internet connection.
