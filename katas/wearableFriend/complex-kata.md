### AI Engineering Sub-Kata: Contextual Understanding and Topic Differentiation

#### Background

For the device to be truly useful, it needs to understand the context of the data it collects and differentiate between different topics. This allows for more accurate and relevant model training, as the system can focus on the most critical information.

#### Current Process

AI models often struggle with context, particularly when dealing with diverse or ambiguous inputs. Differentiating between topics typically requires extensive manual labeling and training.

#### Key Challenges

- Developing algorithms that can accurately determine the context of audio and video data.
- Creating a system that can categorize and tag data according to different topics without requiring extensive manual input.
- Ensuring that the device can adapt to new contexts and topics over time.

#### Objectives

- Implement contextual analysis algorithms to understand the environment, activities, and topics present in the data.
- Develop a topic differentiation system that can automatically categorize data.
- Ensure that the system can update and refine its understanding of context and topics as it collects more data.

#### Data Sources

- Real-time video and audio input from the device.
- Contextual metadata (e.g., location, time of day, known objects or people).
- Pre-labeled datasets to train initial contextual understanding models.

#### Engineering Tasks

- Design and train models for contextual analysis and topic differentiation.
- Implement real-time data tagging and categorization based on context.
- Develop a feedback loop to refine the system’s contextual understanding over time.

#### Constraints

- Limited processing power on the device for real-time contextual analysis.
- The need to ensure that the system’s context and topic identification is accurate and relevant.
- Balancing the need for detailed contextual understanding with user privacy and comfort.
