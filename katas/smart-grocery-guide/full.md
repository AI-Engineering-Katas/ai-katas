# Smart Grocery Guide

## Scenario

A major grocery store chain wants to build an AI-powered assistant that helps shoppers find items in their stores. This assistant will be available both in-store via mobile devices and on the store’s app, which shoppers can use ahead of time to plan their trips.

Users: 500,000+ active app users, 1,000+ stores nationwide, millions of shoppers annually

## Additional Context

- Each store has a unique layout, so the assistant should be able to dynamically adapt to each location.
- The ability to integrate with the store’s inventory system is available to be able to see items details like the name and if it's in stock.
- The stakeholders also mentioned they would like the systemt to support multiple languages to accommodate international customers.

## Requirements

- The app must provide real-time location of items within each store.
- Users can search for items by name, category, or through voice commands.
- The system should offer personalized recommendations based on a user's history and preferences (e.g., vegetarian, organic).
