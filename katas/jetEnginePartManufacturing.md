## AI Engineering Kata: Optimizing Jet Engine Part Manufacturing

### Background

A leading jet engine manufacturer is looking to optimize their manufacturing process for small, delicate engine parts. The current process involves precision robotic machining systems and advanced quality control methods, but faces challenges in precision and material waste. The system also accounts for tool wear degradation, which affects machining accuracy over time.

### Current Process

1. Human operators mount raw materials onto the machining system.
2. Robotic systems perform precise machining operations, adjusting for known tool wear patterns.
3. Finished parts undergo a light-based inspection for quality control.
4. Human operators remove the finished parts.
5. Periodic tool replacement and calibration are performed based on predetermined schedules.

### Key Challenges

1. Mounting Consistency: Ensure uniform mounting of raw materials for accurate machining.
2. Precision: Detect anomalies as small as 0.1mm.
3. Quality Control: Currently only one check at the end of the process.
