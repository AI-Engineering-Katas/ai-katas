SmartSearchAds - Buyer

Google Ads has hired you to improve the user experience of search advertisements for buyers. They identified a gap between the ads that they are paid to serve on user searches and the interests of Google Search users. They want you to create a new service offering for companies who want to serve ads in Google Search.

Requirements:

- An improved user experience for people/companies purchasing the ads.
- Your solution must improve overall value versus ad buying options that are already available.
- The service should cost less than 2x the cost of base tier Google Search Ads.
- The solution needs to account for potential fraud in ad buying.
