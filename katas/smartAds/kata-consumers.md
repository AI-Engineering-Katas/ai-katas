# SmartSearchAds

Google Ads has hired you to improve the user experience of advertisements for the end users of their search engine. They identified a gap between the ads that they are paid to serve on user searches and the interests of Google Search users. They want you to propose new tools or services that will improve the ad experience for these users.

Requirements:

- An improved user experience for end users.
- Your solution should improve the value for companies that buy Google Search Ads by increasing user engagement with these ads.
- The solution needs to account for potential fraud. For example a bot might be clicking on ads to hurt a competitor or inflate their click numbers in order to sell ad services to clients.
