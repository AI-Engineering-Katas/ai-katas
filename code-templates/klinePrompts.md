Use this kata to create a code-template for a developer to implement a genAI software solution to this kata: @/katas/

I want to use this code-template in a workshop to teach developers how to use AI to solve business problems. Workshop attendees will use macbooks, windows, and linux computers, so please create a podman-based dev environment that will allow anyone to get up and running quickly.

The starter template should include a readme that explains each component of the solution, and how it works. This readme should reference the relevant technology page in the building blocks website docs, found locally here @/building-blocks/docs/tools/@/building-blocks/docs/capabilities/@/building-blocks/docs/solutions/ but published to the web here: https://ai-engineering-katas.github.io/ai-katas/
Any references to the building blocks concepts should contain links to the relevant pages in the website url.

It is important that this project does not do ALL of the work for the developer. It should install all of the tools that they need to use, explain how each tool contributes to the whole product, and provide an intuition for how the tool works in a dedicated section in the readme. Also, can you sequence the steps required for the developer to build the app so that there are milestones? Each milestone should offer an opportunity for the developer to test what they have built, and also to celebrate.

At the beginning of the sequence, show one mermaid diagram that is a logical view of the complete architecture and one that is a data flow diagram of the lifecycle of a user's request for a document. At each milestone, show a logical and a data flow diagram of ONLY THE PIECES THAT EXIST AT THE TIME OF MILESTONE COMPLETION

You should do all of the work for setting up a containerized dev environment for the user to work in. Workshop attendees should be able to sit down, run a start-up script, and start building
