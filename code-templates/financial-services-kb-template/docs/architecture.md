- **Metadata Extractor**: Identifies document metadata including access control information

#### Technologies:

- **PyPDF2**: For extracting text from PDF files
- **python-docx**: For extracting text from DOCX files
- **sentence-transformers**: For generating embeddings

#### Building Block Reference:

This component implements the [Document Retrieval Systems](https://ai-engineering-katas.github.io/ai-katas/tools/document-retrieval-systems) building block.

### 2. Vector Database

The vector database stores document embeddings and enables efficient similarity search.

#### Key Components:

- **Vector Storage**: Stores document embeddings

### 3. Query Processing

The query processing system handles natural language queries, converts them to embeddings, and searches for relevant documents.

#### Key Components:

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Processes and understands user queries
- **Query Embedding Generation**: Converts queries to vector embeddings
- **Vector Search**: Searches the vector database for similar documents
- **Result Ranking**: Ranks search results by relevance

#### Technologies:

- **sentence-transformers**: For generating query embeddings
- **Qdrant Client**: For searching the vector database

#### Building Block Reference:

This component implements the [NLP Frameworks](https://ai-engineering-katas.github.io/ai-katas/tools/nlp-frameworks) and [Neural Search](https://ai-engineering-katas.github.io/ai-katas/solutions/neural-search) building blocks.

### 4. Authorization and Access Control

The authorization system ensures that sensitive information is only accessible to authorized users.

#### Key Components:

- **User Authentication**: Simulates user authentication
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Controls access based on user roles
- **Document-Level Permissions**: Enforces access control at the document level

#### Technologies:

- **Custom RBAC Implementation**: Role-based access control system

#### Building Block Reference:

This component implements security best practices for [Knowledge Base Systems](https://ai-engineering-katas.github.io/ai-katas/tools/knowledge-base-systems).

### 5. Document Summarization

The summarization system generates concise summaries of documents to help users quickly understand their content.

#### Key Components:

- **Text Summarization**: Generates summaries of document content
- **Contextual Summarization**: Focuses summaries on the query context

#### Technologies:

- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For text summarization

#### Building Block Reference:

This component implements the [Text Understanding](https://ai-engineering-katas.github.io/ai-katas/capabilities/text-understanding) and [Text Generation](https://ai-engineering-katas.github.io/ai-katas/capabilities/text-generation) capabilities.

### 6. API Gateway

The API gateway provides a unified interface for the frontend to interact with the backend services.

#### Key Components:

- **REST API**: Provides endpoints for querying the knowledge base
- **Request Handling**: Processes incoming requests
- **Response Formatting**: Formats responses for the frontend

#### Technologies:

- **FastAPI**: For building the REST API

### 7. Frontend Interface

The frontend provides a user interface for interacting with the knowledge base.

#### Key Components:

- **Query Interface**: Allows users to enter natural language queries
- **Result Display**: Shows search results with summaries
- **User Role Selection**: Simulates different user roles

#### Technologies:

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For building the user interface
- **Bootstrap**: For styling

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

The system implements role-based access control to ensure that sensitive information is only accessible to authorized users:

- **Public Documents**: Accessible to all users
- **Department-Specific Documents**: Accessible only to users in the relevant department
- **Restricted Documents**: Accessible only to users with specific roles (e.g., managers, executives)

### Data Privacy

The system is designed to comply with data privacy regulations:

- **Document Metadata**: Includes access control information
- **User Roles**: Determine access permissions
- **Query Filtering**: Filters search results based on user permissions

## Performance Considerations

### Scalability

The system is designed to scale with increasing document volumes and user loads:

- **Vector Database**: Scales horizontally for large document collections
- **Containerized Services**: Can be scaled independently based on load
- **Stateless API**: Allows for multiple instances

### Optimization

Several optimization techniques are used to improve performance:

- **Embedding Caching**: Avoids regenerating embeddings for unchanged documents
- **Query Optimization**: Optimizes vector search parameters for speed vs. accuracy
- **Batch Processing**: Processes documents in batches for efficiency

## Extension Points

The system is designed to be extensible in several ways:

### Advanced NLP Features

- **Question Answering**: Generate direct answers to questions
- **Entity Extraction**: Identify entities in documents
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze sentiment in documents

### Integration Capabilities

- **Document Management Systems**: Connect to real document management systems
- **Authentication Systems**: Integrate with enterprise authentication
- **Compliance Systems**: Connect to compliance monitoring systems

### Performance Enhancements

- **Caching**: Implement caching for frequent queries
- **Distributed Processing**: Scale document processing across multiple nodes
- **Batch Processing**: Optimize batch sizes for document processing
